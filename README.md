# TChromeTabs32

TChromeTabs32 is a port of TChromeTabs using [Graphics32](https://github.com/graphics32/graphics32) as graphic engine. TChromeTabs itself is a comprehensive implementation of Google Chrome's tabs for Delphi 6 - Delphi DX10.1 Berlin. It is originally written by Paul Spencer Thornton (norgepaul) with portions by Easy-IP AS

## Current state of development

So far the code compiles, but there are still many places marked with 'TODO' to indicate that there is still work todo. It shouldn't be a matter of more than 1-2 days to get it fully working.

## Installation

TChromeTabs32 has been tested under Delphi 6 and Delphi 10.1 Berlin. To install:

1. Compile `.\Packages\<Delphi Version>\ChromeTabs32_R.dpk`
