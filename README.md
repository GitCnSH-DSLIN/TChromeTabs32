# TChromeTabs32

TChromeTabs32 is a port of [TChromeTabs](https://github.com/norgepaul/TChromeTabs) using [Graphics32](https://github.com/graphics32/graphics32) as graphic engine. TChromeTabs itself is a comprehensive implementation of Google Chrome's tabs for Delphi 6 - Delphi DX10.1 Berlin. It was originally written by Paul Spencer Thornton (norgepaul) with portions by Easy-IP AS

## Current state of development

So far most things are working similar to the original TChromeTabs component. However some corner cases might not be working perfectly. If there are no good reasons I would prefer to use the original project's component.

## Installation

TChromeTabs32 has been tested under Delphi 7 and Delphi XE7. To install:

1. Compile `.\Packages\<Delphi Version>\ChromeTabs32_R.dpk`
2. Compile and Install `.\Packages\<Delphi Version>\ChromeTabs32_D.dpk`
